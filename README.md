# DarthLoader
This is a project heavily inspired by Jean-FranÃ§ois Maes's [SANS  Workshop Reflection in C#](https://www.sans.org/webcasts/sans-workshop-reflection-in-c-/) to help (c)sharpen by C# dev skills. A lot of code was borrowed and/or extended for this project from:
- https://github.com/cobbr/SharpSploit/tree/master/SharpSploit/Evasion
- https://jfmaes-1.gitbook.io/reflection-workshop/
- StackOverflow

DarthLoader will do the following:
- Remotely fetch a .Net assembly from the web using a base64 encoded url and Xor the byte array in memory.
- Fetch a local .Net assembly into memory.
- Bypass ETW and AMSI by decrypting function strings at runtime via xor key being passed as cmdline arg.
- Decrypt and run the assembly from memory.

```

 Ticket requests and renewals:

    Retrieve a TGT based on a user password/hash, optionally saving to a file or applying to the current logon session or a specific LUID:
        Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:USER </password:PASSWORD [/enctype:DES|RC4|AES128|AES256] | /des:HASH | /rc4:HASH | /aes128:HASH | /aes256:HASH> [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/outfile:FILENAME] [/ptt] [/luid] [/nowrap] [/opsec]

    Retrieve a TGT based on a user password/hash, start a /netonly process, and to apply the ticket to the new process/logon session:
        Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:USER </password:PASSWORD [/enctype:DES|RC4|AES128|AES256] | /des:HASH | /rc4:HASH | /aes128:HASH | /aes256:HASH> /createnetonly:C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe [/show] [/domain:DOMAIN] [/dc:DOMAIN_CONTROLLER] [/nowrap] [/opsec]
